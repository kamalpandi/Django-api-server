# Django Multi-App Dashboard

This [repository](https://vibi.pythonanywhere.com/) hosts a **Django project** featuring multiple interactive web applications built with **HTMX** for a dynamic frontend experience. The project is designed to showcase mostly backend and little frontend capabilities, with clean modular architecture and scalable app structure.

## Features

* **ToDo App**: A task management application with CRUD functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks.
* **Weather App**: Provides real-time weather information using external APIs, allowing users to check the current conditions for any city.
* **Pic to ASCII App**: Converts uploaded images into ASCII art (optional app), demonstrating file handling and image processing in Django.
* **Centralized Homepage**: Serves as a landing page with navigation to all included apps.
* **HTMX Integration**: Enhances user experience by enabling dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
* **Modular Architecture**: Each app is self-contained with its own models, views, templates, and static files for maintainability and scalability.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Django, Python 3.14
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, HTMX
* **Database**: SQLite (default for development)
* **Deployment**: PythonAnywhere
* **Tools & Libraries**: HTMX, Requests (for API calls), Pillow (for image handling)
